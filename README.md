Hi, it's Sparsh, an engineer at the University of Waterloo, interested in building cool and useful products.

I'm currently working on building projects and learning DSA. 

**Projects So Far**
  - **Hands** - Hands helps you organize your recipes, decide what to cook, and shop effortlessly. It's the best way to cook with AI. Import any recipe from your favorite blogs, Instagram, and TikTok. Plan weekly meals based on what you like to eat. Find saved recipes by ingredient. Build a smart shopping list in seconds.
    
  - **ExTerrapy** - An AI-powered relationship therapist that takes as input screenshots of your messages with an ex-partner, and based on that, it simulates conversations with your ex-partner. This is counter-intuitive as this "therapy" is quite stupid because usually speaking to your ex-partner isn't very therapeutic which is why this was built during a Stupid Hackathon.
    
  - **LooBites** - A platform for students to view daily residence cafeteria menus and post food reviews. Me and two others built this, however, soon after launching, Waterloo's current food menu application which is very outdated, launched security measures that no longer allowed us to scrape data, however, still a very useful (until Waterloo blocked us) and cool product.
    
  - **Socratic AI** - An AI-powered tool that doesn't give you the answer. The purpose of this is so users actually learn, and their brain struggles/thinks as this is where the learning happens. Nowadays, AI tools such as ChatGPT just give us the answer, eliminating the learning aspect.
    Here is the funnel:
     1) Users enter a topic, and conduct a brain dump (type down everything they know about the topic).
     2) They type what specifically confuses them about the topic, or a question they have.
     3) They type what they have done to find the answer to this question, whether it be read an article, watch a video, etc.
     4) The AI guide asks it a question, the user answers it. This happens 3 times where the AI guide uses questions to push the user to the right direction in obtaining an answer.
   
 - **Trade Regret Simulator (Fantasy Football)** - An ML model that predicts how the rest of the season would have occured if a) a trade did not happen, or b) predict a player's next week fantasy points.
